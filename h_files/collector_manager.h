 *	@breif Header file for the collector manager module, which monitors the cdr_files directory for incoming files. For each incoming cdr file, the collector manager creates a process to start processing said file.  
 *	@warning - The collector_manager will get notifications upon the 	 apearance of CDR files in directory ONLY when cdr_proccesor is in 	  running mode. Hence, the collector manager will not process files 	  introduced prior to the execution of the cdr_processor.
